============================
FAS Flask OpenID Auth Plugin
============================

:Authors: Patrick Uiterwjk
:Date: 18 February 2013
:For Version: 0.3.x

The :ref:`Fedora-Account-System` has a :term:`OpenID` provider that applications
can use to authenticate users in web apps. For our :term:`Flask` applications
we have an identity provider that uses this OpenID service to authenticate users.
It is almost completely compatible with :ref:`flask_fas` except that it does not
use the username/password provided by the client application (it is silently
ignored). It can be configured to use any OpenID authentication service that
implements the OpenID Teams Extension, Simple Registration Extension and
CLA Extension.

-------------
Configuration
-------------

The FAS OpenID auth plugin has several config values that can be used to control
how the auth plugin functions.  You can set these in your application's config
file.

FAS_OPENID_ENDPOINT
    Set this to the OpenID endpoint url you are authenticating against.
    Default is "http://id.fedoraproject.org/"

FAS_CHECK_CERT
    When set, this will check the SSL Certificate for the FAS server to make
    sure that it is who it claims to be.  This is useful to set to False when
    testing against a local FAS server but should always be set to True in
    production.  Default: True

------------------
Sample Application
------------------

The following is a sample, minimal flask application that uses fas_flask for
authentication::
