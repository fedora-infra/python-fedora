:Version: 0.3.x

0.3.6
-----
* fedora.client.pkgdb merge with pkgdb-client from Mike Watters and Toshio
  Kuratomi.
* Generate documentation for json and util modules.
* Delay import of koji, yum, and iniparse in the bodhi client libraries so
  they're not strict dependencies for now.

0.3.5
-----
* Fix client.AccountSystem.person_by_username() to not traceback when given an
  unknown username.
* Deprecate cookie auth in favor of session_id auth (but maintain compatibility)
* Internally, use session_id instead of cookie.
* Change the session file from ~/.fedora_session to ~/.fedora/.fedora_session
* Switch from using setuptools to build the package to paver_.
* Generate html documentation using sphinx_.
* Bodhi update template parsing improvements, thanks to Ricky.

0.3.4
-----
* Fix to proxyclient allow sending sequence types via send_request().
* New fedora.client.fas2.AccountSystem method people_by_groupname()

0.3.3
-----
* Allow json_props in SABase to follow class inheritance.
* Remove 0.2 compatibility variable jsonProps.  This was broken and everything
  that was using it has been ported to use json_props instead.
* Misc bugfixes with the jsonfas provider.

0.3.2
-----
* Bodhi API parameter 'type' renamed to 'type_'
* Added BodhiClient.latest_builds method
* New FAS group_members() method to return people's status in a group.
* Fixed the default fas.url value in the jsonfas visit manager
* Creation of a new FedoraClientError base Exception class
* Better i18n support
* Added all clients to the base of the fedora.client module
* Various other bugfixes

0.3.1
-----
* Fix an unported portion of the jsonfasvisit manager.
* Make validation errors set a flash message for both html and json
* Create a function to jsonify sets.
* Make sure we don't log a user's password.
* Bugfixes in the bodhi update template parsing code

0.3
---
* New fedora.client.bodhi API
* Lots of bugfixes
* New fedora.client.ProxyClient class that can be used for writing proxies and
  lower level clients that talk to Fedora Services.
  - BaseClient rewritten to run on top of ProxyClient.
* Rearranging of many modules.  The old names should still work but issue a
  DeprecationWarning and the new location to import the module from.
* Documentation on how to build a Fedora Service that will work well with
  BaseClient and documentation on building apps with BaseClient.
  - Note that present Fedora Services (Bodhi, PackageDB, MirrorManager, FAS2)
    will need to be updated to conform to this spec.  Until that happens, not
    everything (notably, error handling) will work 100% correctly.

Incompatibilities
=================
* Removal of camelCase.  Rename keyword arguments and public instance variables:
  * client.BaseClient
    *Note* that changes to this class propogate out to the same variable in
    derived classes like fas2.AccountSystem and the BaseClient used in
    JsonFasIdentity.
    * __init__(): baseURL => base_url
    * _sessionCookie => _session_cookie: this is a private variable but some
      users use this anyway.  For users needing to access this, there's now
      a more appropriate class for doing so (ProxyClient).
  * accounts.fas2.AccountSystem
    * group_by_id(): groupId => group_id
    * person_by_id(): personId => person_id
  * tg.widgets
    * All widgets had widgetId => widget_id
    * Also means accessing the variable is done via self.widget_id
  * tg.json.SABase
    * self.jsonProps => self.json_props
      *Note*: jsonProps will still work but is Deprecated.  Please update your
      code as we will be removing jsonProps in 0.4.x.
* The input keyword argument to BaseClient.send_request has been
  deprecated in favor of req_params.
  *Note*: Using input will still work in 0.3.  Please update your code as we
  will be removing input in 0.4.x.
* Restructuring of Exceptions in BaseClient
  * New base exception is FedoraServiceError if you want to catch that.
* Movement of fedora.tg.client to fedora.client
* Movement of fedora.accounts.fas2 to fedora.client.fas2
* Rename fedora.client.fas2.AccountSystem.authenticate() to verify_password()
