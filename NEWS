:Date: 13 Feb 2012
:Version: 0.3.x

------
0.3.26
------

* Fix the AccountSystem() class's verify_password() method so that
  verification of server SSL certificates may be disabled by setting
  insecure=True.
* Fixed AccountSystem.people_by_key() to return a list with both people who
  have signed the CLA and have not
* Fix the tg2.utils.url handling with TG-2.0.x
* Fix a deprecation warning in fedora.tg.controllers
* Fix issue in proxyclient where unicode passwords might be encoded to the
  wrong byte sequence depending on the locale of the process running it.
* Fix jsonfasprovider2's group handling to not traceback when assigning groups
  if there is no record for a given username.
* Fix a traceback in jsonfasprovider2's user_id handling.
* Fix comparison of passwords in jsonfasprovider when unicode passwords are
  used.  However, this method is actually not invoked under normal use as the
  password comparison is done on the server.
* Fix faswho plugin to handle unicode passwords and usernames.  Note that this
  is a different bug than affected the TG1 auth provider.
* Fix faswho auth plugin to set session cookies as secure and httponly
* Set the Django session cookies httponly
* Add a genshi login template for TG2
* For faswho repoze.who plugin, remove caching during authentication (as caching
  does not pick up on logout of a different app invalidating the session and
  password changes).  We could use caching again if retrieving the full
  information about a user took more time than validating their username and
  password.
* Simplify implementation of the faswho plugin.  Should save on per-request
  memory and cache.
* Add AccountSystem.gravatar_url() method that will return a url to a gravatar
  for a person.

--------
0.3.25.1
--------

* Update bugzilla email mapping

------
0.3.25
------

* Modify caching of User data in the tg1 identity provider, jsonfas2provider
  so that anonymous page requests don't call fas excessively.
* Make :func:`fedora.tg.tg2utils.enable_csrf` a public function so that TG2
  users can use it without using faswho
* Make :func:`fedora.tg.tg2utils.url` work with other repoze.who plugins other
  than faswho.
* Allow using a test fas server with :func:`make_faswho_middleware`
* Update faswho metadata to be compatible with the default TG2 identity
  metadata for portability
* Allow recovering authenticated state from lack of csrf_token when using the
  TG2 csrf protecting middleware
* Split the TG1 and TG2 code into two separate directories so packagers can
  split the dependencies even more
* Add login and jsglobals template for TG2-mako
* Modify fedora_template for TG2 -- now defaults to mako templates and returns
  a dotted_lookup string by default.  This matches with the templates we have
  and the default template lookup strategy in TG2.

------
0.3.24
------

* Fix tg.tg2utils._enable_csrf so that redirect() appends the CSRF token
  in TG2.
* Fix an example in the documentation
* Fix a proxyclient error with new pycurl and cookies
* Use transifex.net for translations

------
0.3.23
------
* Get BodhiClient.comment() working with older version of bodhi

------
0.3.22
------

* Bodhi.comment() adds an email parameter to control whether to send email for
  a comment
* Fix ProxyClient issue when using unicode type for a URL
* Fix for AccountSystem.group_members() bug with the Bunch port

------
0.3.21
------

* Add support for uploading files in BaseClient and ProxyClient.
* Add retry capability to BaseClient and ProxyClient.
* Have identity and visit managers retry 3 times.
* Fix some errors in the wsgi csrf middleware.
* Fix wsgi csrf middleware to work with webob >= 1.0
* Fix how we're using data from FasProxy.group_list() in the django auth
  provider
* New PackageDB() methods, :meth:`~fedora.client.PackageDB.add_comaintainers`
  and :meth:`~fedora.client.PackageDB.change_owner`

Internal Cleanups
=================

* Port to kitchen for things that have moved there.
* Port from DictContainer to python-bunch
* Add code to fallback to the stdlib json library so that simplejson is no
  longer required


------
0.3.20
------
* Fix Django auth provider so it times out when the auth provider is used in a
  django + djblets app.

------
0.3.19
------
* Fix DJango Auth Provider to use a cookie shared with the TG apps
* Fix DJango Auth Provider to timeout with the fas session
* Optimize group lookup in DJango auth provider for ReviewBoard
* Add absolute_url() and tg_absolute_url() functions to tg1utils
* Attempt to stop tracebacks in tg.visit code
* Don't crash DJango auth if the user is hiding their Real Name.

------
0.3.18
------
* Fixes for Django auth provider tracebacks and session not being cleared between users.
* Revert the connection pool for ProxyClient.  It was part of the reason that
  Django auth (and the other auth providers although no one noticed) were
  failing.

------
0.3.17
------
* Add a connection pool to ProxyClient.  Reusing the curl objects from the pool
  speeds up requests that go to the same server.
* New class FasProxyClient that is used to implement thread-safe communication
  with the Fedora Account System.  Our authentication plugins that talk to
  FAS have been ported to use this internally.
* For all clients, remove tg_format=json from the requests that are sent.  The
  Accept header that we send has been serving this purpose for a long time.
* New PackageDB methods
  - get_collection_list() that returns the list of collections that are
    registered in the pkgdb.
  - orphan_packages() that returns the list of packages orphaned in non-EOL
    releases.
  - get_critpath_pkgs(): Return the packages marked for the critical path
  - set_critpath(): Mark pkgs as critical path
* In fedora.client.pkgdb, Wherever a collection is asked for, have the API take
  params named collctn_* for consistency.  Using the old names as keyword
  arguments will yield a deprecation warning.
* fedora.client.PackageDB now works with pkgdb server 0.5.x rather than 0.4.x
* fedora.client.wiki: add ignore_wikibot and callback kwargs to
  Wiki.fetch_all_revisions() and minor bug fixes
* New functions:
  - fedora.iterutils.isiterable(): Can tell whether an object is an iterable.
    Can also exclude strings if desired.
  - fedora.urlutils.update_qs(): Updates a http query string.
  - fedora.textutils.to_unicode(): Converts a byte string to unicode string.
  - fedora.textutils.to_bytes(): Converts a unicode string into a byte string.
* Fix fedora.tg.tg1utils.request_format() to return a symbolic name for the
  data format requested whether using the Accept header or tg_format query
  parameter.
* fedora.tg.tg2utils module added with some of the functions from
  fedora.tg.tg1utils ported to TG2.
* faswho and csrf middleware that allow TG2 apps to authenticate against FAS
* Documentation on how to use faswho and CSRF in a TG2 app.
* Fix some bugs in the Django auth layer.

------
0.3.16
------
* Update paver-minilib.zip to pull in more of paver.  Fixes a bug when used
  with easy_install
* Fix a bug in fedora.tg.util.url that was creating more than one _csrf_token
  entry.

------
0.3.15
------
* Relicense to LGPLv2+
* Fix user_gencert URL

------
0.3.14
------
* Save the original tg.url() function as fedora.tg.tg_url().  That allows us
  to change the url to have the base_url without adding the csrf token.
* Update fedora.client.AccountSystem for compatibility with the next FAS
  server update (backwards compatible).
* Add fedora.client.PackageDB.user_packages() method that retrieves the packages
  that a particular user owns.
* Add a function for fetching all revisions of the wiki (fetch_all_revisions)
* Add a function for seeing if we have the wiki API high limits right
  (check_api_limits)
* Add an identity provider, sqlobjectcsrf, to implement csrf_token protection
  for applications that use sqlobject for database interaction and don't want
  to use FAS for auth.

--------
0.3.13.1
--------
* Merge the 0.3.13 and 0.3.12.1 release together.
* Bugfix for Django Auth provider and new fas server.

------
0.3.13
------
* Add new pkgdb methods: add_package() to add a new package and edit_package()
  to edit an existing one.  add_edit_package() was removed.
* More translations.
* Change from 401 response code to 403.  401 was causing problems for konqueror
  and webkit and our usage wasn't http spec compliant.
* New fedora.compat25 that has python-2.5 features for older releases.
  - fedora.compat25.defaultdict a defaultdict implementation for older python
    releases.

--------
0.3.12.1
--------

* Add people_query method
* Rename group_by_id and person_by_id request parameters
* Add force_refresh parameter to group_data

------
0.3.12
------

* Bugfix to django auth to allow login
* Bugfix to jsonfas2 that allows login when using json calls with Cherrypy 2.3+
* Get i18n infrastructure ready and take translations from transifex
* Include a setup.py so easy_install works
* Update build to work with paver 1.0 and somewhat with 0.8
* Add remove_user() to pkgdb client module.

--------
0.3.11.1
--------

* Fix a bug with django auth and redirects

------
0.3.11
------

Re-add the old jsonfasprovider and jsonfasvisit plugins until we get everything
ported over to CSRF protection.  To use the new providers, change your app.cfg::

  -visit.manager="jsonfas"
  -identity.provider="jsonfas"
  +visit.manager="jsonfas2"
  +identity.provider="jsonfas2"

------
0.3.10
------

CSRF
====
CSRF is a vulnerability that can allow malicious web sites to execute server
methods on behalf of an authenticated user.  This update has some methods to
help deal with that:

* Added helpers for enabling CSRF protection to services.  For information on
  adding support to your app, read doc/CSRF.rst or the html version:
  https://fedorahosted.org/releases/p/y/python-fedora/doc/CSRF.html
* Update client code to use CSRF tokens when needed.

Other Feature Changes
=====================
* Add Django Authentication provider.
* Undeprecate AccountSystem.people_by_id() for now -- we need a fas server
  update before we can use people_by_key().
* Correct loggers to show messages originate from jsonfasprovider and
  jsonfasvisit.
* Add parameter to client classes to allow not checking server certificates.
  This is **only** intended for use when running test servers with bad certs.

Bugfixes
========
* python-2.4 compatibility fix when an http error is received in ProxyClient
* Fix fedora.client.ServerError to print information about the error in the
  traceback.

0.3.9.1
-------
* Fix to the mediawiki client for python-2.4 compatibility.

-----
0.3.9
-----
* Minor fix for traceback when the session file is unreadable.
* Fix so that ProxyClient follows redirects.
* Fix a bug where fas2.py::AccountSystem::verify_password() always returns
  True.
* Add task to publish documentation to the website.  Publish documentation to
  the website at: https://fedorahosted.org/releases/p/y/python-fedora/doc/

-----
0.3.8
-----
* Port the client module to use pycurl instead of urllib2.  This prepares the
  way for SSL authentication and fixes a problem with https proxying.
* Fix bug in BodhiClient.testable()
* Update proxyclient to accept either 403 or 401 as http status codes raising
  AuthErrors.
* New client.fas2.AccountSystem methods to make fasClient more efficient:
  - group_data(): returns mapping group names to group type and the userids of
    the administrator, sponsors, and users of the group.
  - user_data(): returns mapping of userids to a username, password hash,
    SSH pub key, email address, and status.
* Fix AppError exception on python-2.4

-----
0.3.7
-----
* Update to bugzilla email addresses.
* Add documentation for working with translations.
* add username argument for BodhiClient.
* Update PackageDB.clone_branch() command for new server method.
* Allow exceptions passed back by the server to contain extra information.
* New fedora.tg.util.json_or_redirect() decorator that allows server methods to
  either return a dict per normal or redirect to another URL.

-----
0.3.6
-----
* fedora.client.pkgdb merge with pkgdb-client from Mike Watters and Toshio
  Kuratomi.
* Generate documentation for json and util modules.
* Delay import of koji, yum, and iniparse in the bodhi client libraries so
  they're not strict dependencies for now.

-----
0.3.5
-----
* Fix client.AccountSystem.person_by_username() to not traceback when given an
  unknown username.
* Deprecate cookie auth in favor of session_id auth (but maintain compatibility)
* Internally, use session_id instead of cookie.
* Change the session file from ~/.fedora_session to ~/.fedora/.fedora_session
* Switch from using setuptools to build the package to paver_.
* Generate html documentation using sphinx_.
* Bodhi update template parsing improvements, thanks to Ricky.

-----
0.3.4
-----
* Fix to proxyclient allow sending sequence types via send_request().
* New fedora.client.fas2.AccountSystem method people_by_groupname()

-----
0.3.3
-----
* Allow json_props in SABase to follow class inheritance.
* Remove 0.2 compatibility variable jsonProps.  This was broken and everything
  that was using it has been ported to use json_props instead.
* Misc bugfixes with the jsonfas provider.

-----
0.3.2
-----
* Bodhi API parameter 'type' renamed to 'type_'
* Added BodhiClient.latest_builds method
* New FAS group_members() method to return people's status in a group.
* Fixed the default fas.url value in the jsonfas visit manager

* Create a function to jsonify sets.
* Make sure we don't log a user's password.
* Bugfixes in the bodhi update template parsing code

---
0.3
---
* New fedora.client.bodhi API
* Lots of bugfixes
* New fedora.client.ProxyClient class that can be used for writing proxies and
  lower level clients that talk to Fedora Services.
  - BaseClient rewritten to run on top of ProxyClient.
* Rearranging of many modules.  The old names should still work but issue a
  DeprecationWarning and the new location to import the module from.
* Documentation on how to build a Fedora Service that will work well with
  BaseClient and documentation on building apps with BaseClient.
  - Note that present Fedora Services (Bodhi, PackageDB, MirrorManager, FAS2)
    will need to be updated to conform to this spec.  Until that happens, not
    everything (notably, error handling) will work 100% correctly.

Incompatibilities
=================
* Removal of camelCase.  Rename keyword arguments and public instance variables:
  * client.BaseClient
    *Note* that changes to this class propogate out to the same variable in
    derived classes like fas2.AccountSystem and the BaseClient used in
    JsonFasIdentity.
    * __init__(): baseURL => base_url
    * _sessionCookie => _session_cookie: this is a private variable but some
      users use this anyway.  For users needing to access this, there's now
      a more appropriate class for doing so (ProxyClient).
  * accounts.fas2.AccountSystem
    * group_by_id(): groupId => group_id
    * person_by_id(): personId => person_id
  * tg.widgets
    * All widgets had widgetId => widget_id
    * Also means accessing the variable is done via self.widget_id
  * tg.json.SABase
    * self.jsonProps => self.json_props
      *Note*: jsonProps will still work but is Deprecated.  Please update your
      code as we will be removing jsonProps in 0.4.x.
* The input keyword argument to BaseClient.send_request has been
  deprecated in favor of req_params.
  *Note*: Using input will still work in 0.3.  Please update your code as we
  will be removing input in 0.4.x.
* Restructuring of Exceptions in BaseClient
  * New base exception is FedoraServiceError if you want to catch that.
* Movement of fedora.tg.client to fedora.client
* Movement of fedora.accounts.fas2 to fedora.client.fas2
* Rename fedora.client.fas2.AccountSystem.authenticate() to verify_password()
