"""Teams extension request and response parsing and object representation

This module contains objects representing team extension requests 
and responses that can be used with both OpenID relying parties and
OpenID providers.

    1. The relying party creates a request object and adds it to the
       C{L{AuthRequest<openid.consumer.consumer.AuthRequest>}} object
       before making the C{checkid_} request to the OpenID provider::

        auth_request.addExtension(TeamsRequest(requested=['team']))

    2. The OpenID provider extracts the teams extension request from
       the OpenID request using C{L{TeamsRequest.fromOpenIDRequest}},
       gets the user's approval and team membership, creates a C{L{TeamsResponse}}
       object and adds it to the C{id_res} response::

        teams_req = TeamsRequest.fromOpenIDRequest(checkid_request)
        # [ get the user's approval and team membership, informing the user that
        #   the groups in teams_response were requested and accepted ]
        teams_resp = TeamsResponse.extractResponse(teams_req, group_memberships)
        teams_resp.toMessage(openid_response.fields)

    3. The relying party uses C{L{TeamsResponse.fromSuccessResponse}} to
       exxtract the data from the OpenID response::

        teams_resp = TeamsResponse.fromSuccessResponse(success_response)
