class ProxyClient(object):

    '''
    A client to a Fedora Service.  This class is optimized to proxy multiple
    users to a service.  ProxyClient is designed to be threadsafe so that
    code can instantiate one instance of the class and use it for multiple
    requests for different users from different threads.

    If you want something that can manage one user's connection to a Fedora
    Service, then look into using BaseClient instead.

    This class has several attributes.  These may be changed after
    instantiation however, please note that this class is intended to be
    threadsafe.  Changing these values when another thread may affect more
    than just the thread that you are making the change in.  (For instance,
    changing the debug option could cause other threads to start logging debug
    messages in the middle of a method.)

    .. attribute:: base_url

        Initial portion of the url to contact the server.  It is highly
        recommended not to change this value unless you know that no other
        threads are accessing this :class:`ProxyClient` instance.

    .. attribute:: useragent

        Changes the useragent string that is reported to the web server.

    .. attribute:: session_name

        Name of the cookie that holds the authentication value.

    .. attribute:: session_as_cookie

        If :data:`True`, then the session information is saved locally as
        a cookie.  This is here for backwards compatibility.  New code should
        set this to :data:`False` when constructing the :class:`ProxyClient`.

    .. attribute:: debug

        If :data:`True`, then more verbose logging is performed to aid in
        debugging issues.

    .. attribute:: insecure

        If :data:`True` then the connection to the server is not checked to be
        sure that any SSL certificate information is valid.  That means that
        a remote host can lie about who it is.  Useful for development but
        should not be used in production code.

    .. attribute:: retries

        Setting this to a positive integer will retry failed requests to the
        web server this many times.  Setting to a negative integer will retry
        forever.

            for testing against a local version of a server with a self-signed
