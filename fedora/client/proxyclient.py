class ProxyClient(object):
    # pylint: disable-msg=R0903
    '''
    A client to a Fedora Service.  This class is optimized to proxy multiple
    users to a service.  ProxyClient is designed to be threadsafe so that
    code can instantiate one instance of the class and use it for multiple
    requests for different users from different threads.

    If you want something that can manage one user's connection to a Fedora
    Service, then look into using BaseClient instead.

    This class has several attributes.  These may be changed after
    instantiation however, please note that this class is intended to be
    threadsafe.  Changing these values when another thread may affect more
    than just the thread that you are making the change in.  (For instance,
    changing the debug option could cause other threads to start logging debug
    messages in the middle of a method.)

    .. attribute:: base_url

        Initial portion of the url to contact the server.  It is highly
        recommended not to change this value unless you know that no other
        threads are accessing this :class:`ProxyClient` instance.

    .. attribute:: useragent

        Changes the useragent string that is reported to the web server.

    .. attribute:: session_name

        Name of the cookie that holds the authentication value.

    .. attribute:: session_as_cookie

        If :data:`True`, then the session information is saved locally as
        a cookie.  This is here for backwards compatibility.  New code should
        set this to :data:`False` when constructing the :class:`ProxyClient`.

    .. attribute:: debug

        If :data:`True`, then more verbose logging is performed to aid in
        debugging issues.

    .. attribute:: insecure

        If :data:`True` then the connection to the server is not checked to be
        sure that any SSL certificate information is valid.  That means that
        a remote host can lie about who it is.  Useful for development but
        should not be used in production code.

    .. attribute:: retries

        Setting this to a positive integer will retry failed requests to the
        web server this many times.  Setting to a negative integer will retry
        forever.

    .. attribute:: timeout
        A float describing the timeout of the connection. The timeout only
        affects the connection process itself, not the downloading of the
        response body. Defaults to 120 seconds.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.3.33
        Added the timeout attribute

            to maintain compatibility for the 0.3 branch.  In 0.4, code will
            have to deal with session_id's instead of cookies.
        :kwarg debug: If True, log debug information
        :kwarg insecure: If True, do not check server certificates against
            their CA's.  This means that man-in-the-middle attacks are
            possible against the `BaseClient`. You might turn this option on
            for testing against a local version of a server with a self-signed
            certificate but it should be off in production.
        :kwarg retries: if we get an unknown or possibly transient error from
            the server, retry this many times.  Setting this to a negative
            number makes it try forever.  Defaults to zero, no retries.
        :kwarg timeout: A float describing the timeout of the connection. The
            timeout only affects the connection process itself, not the downloading
            of the response body. Defaults to 120 seconds.

            :cookie: **Deprecated** Use ``session_id`` instead.  If both
                ``cookie`` and ``session_id`` are set, only ``session_id`` will
                be used.  A ``Cookie.SimpleCookie`` to send as a session cookie
                to the server
            :session_id: Session id to put in a cookie to construct an identity
                for the server
            :username: Username to send to the server
            :password: Password to use with username to send to the server
            :httpauth: If set to ``basic`` then use HTTP Basic Authentication
                to send the username and password to the server.  This may be
                extended in the future to support other httpauth types than
                ``basic``.

            Note that cookie can be sent alone but if one of username or
            password is set the other must as well.  Code can set all of these
            if it wants and all of them will be sent to the server.  Be careful
            of sending cookies that do not match with the username in this
            case as the server can decide what to do in this case.
        :kwarg file_params: dict of files where the key is the name of the
            file field used in the remote method and the value is the local
            path of the file to be uploaded.  If you want to pass multiple
            files to a single file field, pass the paths as a list of paths.
        :kwarg retries: if we get an unknown or possibly transient error from
            the server, retry this many times.  Setting this to a negative
            number makes it try forever.  Default to use the :attr:`retries`
            value set on the instance or in :meth:`__init__`.

            timeout only affects the connection process itself, not the
            downloading of the response body. Defaults to the :attr:`timeout`
            value set on the instance or in :meth:`__init__`.
        :returns: If ProxyClient is created with session_as_cookie=True (the
            default), a tuple of session cookie and data from the server.
